# Malaria-Parasite-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning-Approach
This project focuses on the detection of malaria parasites in blood smear images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transfer Learning. The goal is to develop a robust model that can accurately classify images as either 'Infected' or 'Uninfected' with malaria parasites.

The dataset used in this project contains 27,558 images and is divided into two folders:

Infected: Images of blood smears that are infected with malaria parasites.
Uninfected: Images of blood smears that are not infected with malaria parasites.
The dataset is sourced from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
