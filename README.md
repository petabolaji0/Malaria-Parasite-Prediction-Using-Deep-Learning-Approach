# Malaria-Parasite-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning-Approach
This project investigates the impact of varying convolutional layer depths in custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for automated malaria parasite detection in blood smear images. Five CNN models, ranging from one to five convolutional layers, were trained and evaluated on a dataset of 27,558 images from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
